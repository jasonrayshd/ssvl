Notice:  
(1) Pretraining file entrypoint:  run_mae_pretraining.py  engine_for_pretraining.py
(2) Fintuning file entrypoint:  run_class_finetuning.py  engine_for_finetuning.py
(3) Bash scripts are written for runninng different tasks:  
    e.g. local_pretrain_ts_epic.sh is used to pretrain our method on local machine. it will read config from config/pretrain_ts_epic55.yml

(4) Model definition for pretraining: modeling_pretrain.py  
    Model definition for fintuning: modeling_finetune.py  

(5) Dataset file: ego4d.py, epickitchens.py  

(6) Logics of online extracting flow images from ego4d/epic-kitchens  
    a. For each subprocess (identified by global rank), initialize a multiprocessing.Manager object and register flow extracting function  
    b. start the Manager object as a seperate process on each gpu and pass it to Dataset object as a parameter  
    c. extract optical flow in function Dataset.__getitem__  




Update:  
2022.07.08   
(1) new feature added: support load arguments from yml configuration file  
(2) support pretraining and finetuning on ego4d, epic-kitchen, kinetics, ssv2
